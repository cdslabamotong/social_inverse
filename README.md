Code for Social-Inverse.

Please download data and pretrain models at https://udel.edu/~amotong/dataset/social_inverse/

The one-slack cutting plane algorithm is implemented based on Pystruct.

Except "cvxopt" for quadratic programming, other require packages such as numpy and torch are common.

cvxopt can be installed via pip. (Conda seems to do not have cvxopt)

Thank you.
