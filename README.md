# Social-Inverse

Code for USCO-Solver.

**Social-Inverse: Inverse Decision-making of Social Contagion Management with Task Migrations, NeurIPS 2022**

The one-slack cutting plane algorithm is implemented based on Pystruct.

Except "cvxopt" for quadratic programming, other require packages such as numpy and torch are common.

cvxopt can be installed via pip. (Conda seems to do not have cvxopt)

Thank you.
